# Demo

This demo shows how to manually develop a node that exposes a single device — a signal generator with its own properties.

Alternatively, [nyx-demo-c](https://github.com/nyxlib/nyx-demo-c) and [nyx-demo-cpp](https://github.com/nyxlib/nyx-demo-cpp) respectively demonstrate how to develop a similar device in C or  C++, this time using [Nyx-Assistant](https://github.com/nyxlib/nyx-assistant/) and [Nyx-Gen](https://github.com/nyxlib/nyx-gen/) to graphically define the node architecture and automatically generate the code skeleton and glue.

## Interface
